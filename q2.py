# 🌱 Question 2 — Listening and replying

Write a program that:
- asks the user for their favorite color using input
- stores it in a variable
- prints a sentence using that value

```md
Your favorite color is blue
```



## Understanding

take a user input of color. store it & then print it.



## Edge Cases

No, edge case for such a simple thing...
We will assume, user will input a color name and we go with it (print it)...



## Brute Force Approach

Time:  O(1) ->  ≈2 ms
Space: O(1) ->  ≈N bits (N = No. of character user inputs)

```python
color = input("Enter a name of a color: ")
print(f"Your favorite color is {color}.")
```



## Optimized Solution

...

Time:  O(1) ->  ≈2 ms
Space: O(1) ->  ≈N bits (N = No. of character user inputs)

```python
# No optimization possible!!
color = input("Enter a name of a color: ")
print(f"Your favorite color is {color}.")
```

"""

color = input("Enter a name of a color: ")
print(f"Your favorite color is {color}.")
