# Data Structures & Algorithms

this repository will remain as an unmainted, completely cluttered repository..
but I will try, my best to keep things organized (enough so that one can find things around) 
though that not the goal... the repository is solely for documenting my journey in DSA..

## Manifesto

you can checkout the [manifesto](manifesto.md) or get more infomation, about what and why this is.

## Rules & Structure (Abstract)

- every question will have its own dedicated `.py` file.
- each py-file will have a solution in it as python code, obiviously...
- along with solution, every file will have a lot of extra stuff as comment.
- there will be more or less regural updates to this repository...
- other than this rules, the enitre repository, along with its commit history will be unmainted.

## Conclusion 

you can use this repository in any way you want... but if you like the work then don't forget to give a star to this repository.

And yes ofcourse as i am fan of open source, you can fork this repository, edit it and submit a pr to this repository.
I willn't mind looking into your solution... and accept it..... (as in merge your pr)
